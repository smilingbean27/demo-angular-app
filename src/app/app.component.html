<pre>
Process of events firing when user clicks the button (Child to Parent data transfer) -->
    1. Click event fires, and sendMyNumber method is called.
    2. Inside sendMyNumber method, newNumEvent emits the value to be sent by firing the event.
    3. As soon as newNumEvent fires, it calls receiveNum with $event as parameter ($event keyword captures the emitting value)
    4. And receiveNum method updates the value receivedNumber

    For Two way data binding (banana or shorthand syntax ):
        1. Make sure you keep property names in Input, Output decorators as - property1 and property1Change, size and sizeChange, etc.
